Terrorism has had a profound impact on societies and geopolitics worldwide over the last five decades. Understanding its patterns is vital for both academic research and practical policymaking. In this project, we conduct an exploratory data analysis of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), leveraging the rich data available for 1970--2017. Our objective is to uncover large-scale trends in terrorist activity, identify geographic and temporal hotspots, and highlight key actors through a series of data visualizations.

The main goals are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Identify long-term temporal trends in annual attack counts and explore their correlation with fatalities.
  \item Reveal within-year cycles by analyzing month-by-month attack seasonality.
  \item Map the geographic distribution of attacks, both by country and by aggregated region.
  \item Highlight the most active terrorist groups and analyze how their operations evolved over time.
\end{itemize}

By providing a comprehensive visual overview, we aim to support a deeper understanding of terrorism as a global phenomenon and offer insights for further research or policy response.
